                <p>Don’t wait a week to talk to your coach or counselor about something pressing. Have direct access to
                    me so you can get feedback, make tough decisions, and implement change in real-time.</p>

                <p>Plus, it’s more cost-effective than traditional weekly therapy if you’re working through a specific
                    issue.</p>

                <p>All questions answered via Voxer, a messaging app. You can submit either an audio or video recording
                    to me through our private and personal thread, and I will respond within 1-Day.</p>

                <p>Make sure to include your email with payment. Then you should receive an email from me with
                    instructions within 1-2 hours of signing up.</p>

                <p>**If you are in crisis, are having thoughts of self-harm, or are struggling with a serious mental
                    illness, this service is not for you. Click here and here for resources and support.</p>
